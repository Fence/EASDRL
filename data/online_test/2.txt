Adapt a mouse to click with your foot.
Obtain a second USB mouse.  
Use one for moving the cursor. 
The other for clicking is on the floor to be foot-operated.
Cut 2 short pieces of plastic tubing, such as 1.9 cm plastic conduit. 
Drill a hole in one side: 0.6 cm or a little larger. 
Insert a small bit in the drill and drill a small hole on the side opposite the large hole. 
Repeat for each of the two pieces. 
Drill a small pilot hole in each of the two mouse buttons. 
Put a bit of glue on the piece of tubing around the small hole.
Insert a screw through the hole from inside the tubing. 
Using the large hole for screwdriver access, screw the piece of tubing onto a mouse button. 
Repeat for each of the two buttons. 
For best ease of use, take a piece of Styrofoam insulation board and cut it to around a 1 foot square. 
Cut a notch in one edge to fit the mouse.
Optionally, put foam weatherstripping on top of the tubing to pad it.  
Duct tape can help hold it in place.
It may be easier to click the mouse without the padding, so only use it if you need it.
