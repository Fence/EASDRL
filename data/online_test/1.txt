Accept that your computer is slow. 
Don't click anything too fast or try to refresh the page. 
Don't overreact; just leave the computer alone, don't click anything, the best thing to do is just to let it load.
Clear your computer of all unnecessary documents.  
Clear your recycle bin every once in a while to delete unnecessary files. 
Avoid opening up several tabs at once.  
Clicking back and forth between several tabs probably won't happen either.
Save everything you work on several times. 
The last thing you want is to have your computer crash as you top off that 10-page essay. 
Consider using the internet when everyone in your household is asleep, or essentially  not  using the internet. 
Forget videos.  
If you have dial-up internet, it can take up to half an hour to load one to two-minute video. 
Unless you can leave your computer alone for hours to let it load, just forget about it. 
You can live without online videos!
